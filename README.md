(Some graphical glitches were introduced when converting this to a GIF)

### Usage:
Use [wasd] to move and the mouse to look around.

### Building the project:
Right now, this project only supports MacOS and requires SDL to be installed. Slight changes to the makefile should allow the project to be built on other operating systems.
