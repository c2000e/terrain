# terrain

A real-time marching cubes based terrain generation system made with C.

### Usage:
Use [wasd] to move and the mouse to look around.

### Building the project:
Right now, this project only supports MacOS and requires SDL to be installed. Slight changes to the makefile should allow the project to be built on other operating systems.
